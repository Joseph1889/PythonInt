The objects do not need to have the same type.\n","\n","Chapter Objects, values and types states that objects have a value (in\n","addition to type and identity).  The value of an object is a rather\n","abstract notion in Python: For example, there is no canonical access\n","method for an object’s value.  Also, there is no requirement that the\n","value of an object should be constructed in a particular way, e.g.\n","comprised of all its data attributes. Comparison operators implement a\n","particular notion of what the value of an object is.  One can think of\n","them as defining the value of an object indirectly, by means of their\n","comparison implementation.\n","\n","Because all types are (direct or indirect) subtypes of \"object\", they\n","inherit the default comparison behavior from \"object\".  Types can\n","customize their comparison behavior by implementing *rich comparison\n","methods* like \"__lt__()\", described in Basic customization.\n","\n","The default behavior for equality comparison (\"==\" and \"!=\") is based\n","on the identity of the objects.  Hence, equality comparison of\n","instances with the same identity results in equality, and equality\n","comparison of instances with different identities results in\n","inequality.  A motivation for this default behavior is the desire that\n","all objects should be reflexive (i.e. \"x is y\" implies \"x == y\").\n","\n","A default order comparison (\"<\", \">\", \"<=\", and \">=\") is not provided;\n","an attempt raises \"TypeError\".  A motivation for this default behavior\n","is the lack of a similar invariant as for equality.\n","\n","The behavior of the default equality comparison, that instances with\n","different identities are always unequal, may be in contrast to what\n","types will need that have a sensible definition of object value and\n","value-based equality.  Such types will need to customize their\n","comparison behavior, and in fact, a number of built-in types have done\n","that.\n","\n","The following list describes the comparison behavior of the most\n","important built-in types.\n","\n","* Numbers of built-in numeric types (Numeric Types — int, float,\n","  complex) and of the standard library types \"fractions.Fraction\" and\n","  \"decimal.Decimal\" can be compared within and across their types,\n","  with the restriction that complex numbers do not support order\n","  comparison.  Within the limits of the types involved, they compare\n","  mathematically (algorithmically) correct without loss of precision.\n","\n","  The not-a-number values \"float('NaN')\" and \"decimal.Decimal('NaN')\"\n","  are special.  Any ordered comparison of a number to a not-a-number\n","  value is false. A counter-intuitive implication is that not-a-number\n","  values are not equal to themselves.  For example, if \"x =\n","  float('NaN')\", \"3 < x\", \"x < 3\" and \"x == x\" are all false, while \"x\n","  != x\" is true.  This behavior is compliant with IEEE 754.\n","\n","* \"None\" and \"NotImplemented\" are singletons.  **PEP 8** advises that\n","  comparisons for singletons should always be done with \"is\" or \"is\n","  not\", never the equality operators.\n","\n","* Binary sequences (instances of \"bytes\" or \"bytearray\") can be\n","  compared within and across their types.  They compare\n","  lexicographically using the numeric values of their elements.\n","\n","* Strings (instances of \"str\") compare lexicographically using the\n","  numerical Unicode code points (the result of the built-in function\n","  \"ord()\") of their characters. [3]\n","\n","  Strings and binary sequences cannot be directly compared.\n","\n","* Sequences (instances of \"tuple\", \"list\", or \"range\") can be compared\n","  only within each of their types, with the restriction that ranges do\n","  not support order comparison.  Equality comparison across these\n","  types results in inequality, and ordering comparison across these\n","  types raises \"TypeError\".\n","\n","  Sequences compare lexicographically using comparison of\n","  corresponding elements.  The built-in containers typically assume\n","  identical objects are equal to themselves.  That lets them bypass\n","  equality tests for identical objects to improve performance and to\n","  maintain their internal invariants.\n","\n","  Lexicographical comparison between built-in collections works as\n","  follows:\n","\n","  * For two collections to compare equal, they must be of the same\n","    type, have the same length, and each pair of corresponding\n","    elements must compare equal (for example, \"[1,2] == (1,2)\" is\n","    false because the type is not the same).\n","\n","  * Collections that support order comparison are ordered the same as\n","    their first unequal elements (for example, \"[1,2,x] <= [1,2,y]\"\n","    has the same value as \"x <= y\").  If a corresponding element does\n","    not exist, the shorter collection is ordered first (for example,\n","    \"[1,2] < [1,2,3]\" is true).\n","\n","* Mappings (instances of \"dict\") compare equal if and only if they\n","  have equal \"(key, value)\" pairs. Equality comparison of the keys and\n","  values enforces reflexivity.\n","\n","  Order comparisons (\"<\", \">\", \"<=\", and \">=\") raise \"TypeError\".\n","\n","* Sets (instances of \"set\" or \"frozenset\") can be compared within and\n","  across their types.\n","\n","  They define order comparison operators to mean subset and superset\n","  tests.  Those relations do not define total orderings (for example,\n","  the two sets \"{1,2}\" and \"{2,3}\" are not equal, nor subsets of one\n","  another, nor supersets of one another).  Accordingly, sets are not\n","  appropriate arguments for functions which depend on total ordering\n","  (for example, \"min()\", \"max()\", and \"sorted()\" produce undefined\n","  results given a list of sets as inputs).\n","\n","  Comparison of sets enforces reflexivity of its elements.\n","\n","* Most other built-in types have no comparison methods implemented, so\n","  they inherit the default comparison behavior.\n","\n","User-defined classes that customize their comparison behavior should\n","follow some consistency rules, if possible:\n","\n","* Equality comparison should be reflexive. In other words, identical\n","  objects should compare equal:\n","\n","     \"x is y\" implies \"x == y\"\n","\n","* Comparison should be symmetric. In other words, the following\n","  expressions should have the same result:\n","\n","     \"x == y\" and \"y == x\"\n","\n","     \"x != y\" and \"y != x\"\n","\n","     \"x < y\" and \"y > x\"\n","\n","     \"x <= y\" and \"y >= x\"\n","\n","* Comparison should be transitive. The following (non-exhaustive)\n","  examples illustrate that:\n","\n","     \"x > y and y > z\" implies \"x > z\"\n","\n","     \"x < y and y <= z\" implies \"x < z\"\n","\n","* Inverse comparison should result in the boolean negation. In other\n","  words, the following expressions should have the same result:\n","\n","     \"x == y\" and \"not x != y\"\n","\n","     \"x < y\" and \"not x >= y\" (for total ordering)\n","\n","     \"x > y\" and \"not x <= y\" (for total ordering)\n","\n","  The last two expressions apply to totally ordered collections (e.g.\n","  to sequences, but not to sets or mappings).
